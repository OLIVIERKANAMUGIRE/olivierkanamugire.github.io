I am a mathematician with research interests in the following:

- applied mathematics & optimization
- machine learning
- biomedical deep learning

I am currently affiliated with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS-Rwanda). Through my teaching assistantship and academic training, I have developed a strong background:

- mathematical analysis
- probability theory and statistics
- computational methods.

My training includes experience in advanced mathematics, numerical analysis, and scientific programming.

I am interested in research problems that require a combination of theoretical analysis and computational implementation. I am keen to further strengthen this dual theoretical–computational perspective during my doctoral studies.

This website provides information about my academic background, research interests, and ongoing projects.
