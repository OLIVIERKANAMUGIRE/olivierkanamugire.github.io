I am a mathematician with strong interests in applied mathematics, optimization, and the mathematical foundations of machine learning. I am currently affiliated with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS-Rwanda), where I have been developing a solid background in rigorous mathematical analysis, probability, and computational methods through teaching assistantship.


Through my academic training, I have gained experience in advanced mathematics, numerical methods, and programming for scientific applications. I enjoy working on problems that require both theoretical insight and computational implementation, and I am keen to further strengthen this dual perspective during my doctoral studies.

This website collects information about my academic background, research interests, and ongoing projects.
