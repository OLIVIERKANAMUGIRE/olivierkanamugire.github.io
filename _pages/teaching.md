At the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, my teaching aims to:

- **Foster deep understanding:** Encourage students to grasp the core concepts, not just memorize formulas.
- **Encourage collaboration:** Cultivate a learning environment where students can share ideas and learn from each other.
- **Support lifelong learning:** Inspire curiosity and independent learning habits that last beyond the classroom.
